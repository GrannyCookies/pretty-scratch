# Pretty Scratch
Scratch- for the better.

Pretty Scratch is pure CSS, and subtly changes the Scratch site to make it easier on the eyes, and more appealing.
Install it temporarilly and see for yourself.
If you don't like it you can always delete the style :)

## How to install
Using [Stylish](https://userstyles.org/), create a new style for the domain "scratch.mit.edu" and put this code in it.
```
@import url("http://scratchextproxy.x10.mx/pretty-scratch.php");
```
